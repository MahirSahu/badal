  <div id="1">it is a mathematical measure of the avg relationship between two or more vriables
 </div>
<h2>linear relation</h2>
<div id="2">if the vriables in a bivariate distribution are related we find that the points in the scatter diagram will cluster around some curve called curve of regression</div>
<div class="25">if the curve is a straight line it is called a line of regression and they are said to be a linear regression, otherwise it is said to be curvilinear</div>
<h2>scatter diagram</h2>
<div>it is the simplest way of the diagrammatic representation of bivariate data</div>
<h3>karl pearson's coefficient of correlation.</h3>
<div class="25">correlation coefficient between two random variables X and Y , usually denoted by r(X,Y), is anumerical measure of linear relationship between them</div>
